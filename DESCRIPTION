Description: The immediate results of statistical analyses generated by R are 
  rarely in a form that is ideal for the intended audience's use and 
  consumption. The `tabler` package contains functions (and accompanying 
  strategies) we can use to make our tabular results ready for presentation 
  and/or dissemination.
