title: "Experimenting"

I'm just trying to get a feel for how I want tabler to work. Very preliminary stuff. This document will be erased before doing a build check.

Basic skeleton for tabler
* Don’t worry about compatibility with freq tables and mean tables. Just think I’m terms of base R and summarize

Documentation
* Experimenting: Just for you. wrap your head around where this is going.
* Why tabler: What would you do without the tabler package?
* README: Overview of how to use tabler.
