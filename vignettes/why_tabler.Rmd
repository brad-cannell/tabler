# Overview

Summary tables are one of the most popular ways to present information to our audiences. In particular, summary tables can be the most clear and concise way to present information when our goal is to show our audience precise numerical summaries of our data. However, the immediate results of statistical analyses generated by R are rarely in a form that is ideal for the intended audience's use and consumption. 

For example, let's say we want to provide a table of basic summary statistics for each variable in the hypothetical study data that is packaged with `tabler` to some stakeholder -- frequency counts for categorical variables and means for numeric variables. Perhaps the simplest way to approach is to simply create a code chunk for each variable, do the calculation of interest, print the results to a document (perhaps using markdown), and disseminate that document to the stakeholder. In other words, we would present something that looks like the following for each variable in the data frame.

```{r}
# Example categorical variable 
table(study$age_group)
```

```{r}
# Example continuous variable
mean(study$age)
```

While repeating code chunks like the two above for each variable in our data frame and sharing the results with our stakeholders would technically get the job done, it isn't ideal. Just presenting raw output like the output above is easy for others to misinterpret, makes it difficult for them to make comparisons, and isn't very aesthetically pleasing. 

The goal of the `tabler` package is to give users functions (and accompanying strategies) that make it as painless as possible to prepare and disseminate summary tables that are easy to understand and are aesthetically pleasing. However, the specific details that we may want to present from table to table, or the way in which we want to present them, can vary widely. For example, an initial table of descriptive information about our participants may or may not be stratified by subgroups of interest. Additionally, our tables may include variables of different types (i.e., numerical or categorical), and for any given type, we may want to include various different kinds of summaries statistics. For these reasons, it is difficult to create a good one-size-fits-all approach to automating the process of making results ready for presentation and dissemination. Therefore, the `tabler` package attempts to walk a line between being automated enough to speed up the creation of summary tables in a meaningful way while also being flexible enough to create as many different kinds of summary tables as possible.  

Before demonstrating the `tabler` approach to creating tables, we walk through how we might have created tables of varying levels of complexity without the `tabler` package.

This part says nothing about formatting. This is just generating the data. We might want to say that are approach is broken into two parts. Calculating summary statistics and creating formatted Word tables from the data frames of summary statistics.


# Ungrouped summaries - only one summary function.

```{r}
# Create example data
ex_1 <- select(study, age, ht_in, wt_lbs, bmi)
```

```{r}
# Iteratively calculate statistics for each column
ex_1_stats <- map_df(
  .x = ex_1,
  .f = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)
)

ex_1_stats
```
```{r}
# Start formatting
ex_1_stats <- ex_1_stats %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(),
    names_to = "variable",
    values_to = "means"
  )

ex_1_stats
```

```{r}
ex_1_ft <- flextable(ex_1_stats)
```


```{r}
# Add to Word document
ex_1_doc <- read_docx()
ex_1_doc <- body_add_flextable(ex_1_doc, ex_1_ft)
print(ex_1_doc, "ex_1_doc.docx")
```





# Grouped summaries - only one summary function.


# Divide all variables into either categorical or continuous - one summary function for each.


# Set a different function for each variable.

Use a data frame for this?


# Create summary tables with multiple grouping variables - an overall column.



## 🔵 Example: Table 1

This first example is perhaps the most common type of table we will create -- a Table 1 -- or basic descriptive table about our participants. 

Let's start by looking at a complete example:

```{r random-pic-from-url, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/example_table_1.png")
```

Here is the minimum code needed to achieve the result in the screenshot above. Below, we will break this code down step-by-step.

```{r}
n_outcome <- study %>% 
  count(outcome) %>% 
  pull(n) %>%
  set_names(levels(study$outcome))
```

```{r}
cont_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Calculations
    group_by({{ .outcome }}) %>% 
    mean_table({{ .pred }}) %>% 
    # Format statistics
    mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
    select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
    # Display by group_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "group_cat",
      values_from = "mean_95"
    ) %>%
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}
```

```{r}
cat_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Remove rows with missing values
    filter(!is.na({{ .pred }})) %>% 
    # Calculations
    freq_table({{ .outcome }}, {{ .pred }}) %>%  
    # Format statistics
    freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>%
    # Keep columns of interest
    select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
    # Display by row_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "row_cat",
      values_from = "percent_95"
    ) %>% 
    # Add spaces in front of category labels
    mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>% 
    # Slide category labels under row variable label
    add_row(col_cat = !!quo_name(enquo(.pred)), .before = 1) %>% 
    select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}
```

```{r}
cont_cols <- c("age", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi")
```

```{r}
cat_cols <- c("age_group", "sex", "bmi_4cat", "exposure")
```

```{r}

  cont_cols %>%
    set_names(cont_cols) %>%

  cat_cols %>%
    set_names(cat_cols) %>% 
    map(~ cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x)))
)
```

```{r}
table_1 <- map_dfr(
  .x = c("exposure", "age", "age_group", "sex", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi", "bmi_4cat"),
  .f = ~ bind_rows(stats_list[[.x]])
)
```

```{r}
table_1_ft <- flextable(table_1) %>% 
  # Change column widths. figure out through trial and error
  width(width = c(2.5, 2.01, 2.01)) %>%

After cleaning your data, which isn't covered in this chapter, a typical workflow for creating a Table 1 like this may look like the following:

### Step 1. Calculate the outcome distribution

As our first step, we typically want to see how many people have each value for the outcome of interest. We will also store these values so that we can add them to our table header as (N = XX) later.

```{r}
n_outcome <- study %>% 
  count(outcome) %>% 
  pull(n) %>%
  set_names(levels(study$outcome))

n_outcome
```

### Step 2. Prepare to calculate summary statistics 

#### Calculate statistics for single variables

Eventually, we are going to want to calculate summary statistics for multiple different variables that will go into our Table 1. Before we do that, it can be useful to write code that will calculate the summary statistics we are interested in for one continuous variable and one categorical variable. Later, we can use [iterative processing](https://www.r4epi.com/introduction-to-repeated-operations.html) to apply that code to all of the variables we are interested in.

<div class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** This chapter isn't about how to calculate or interpret all the various different statistics we may want to calculate from project to project. For more details on descriptive statistics see:

* [R4Epi Descriptive Analysis](https://www.r4epi.com/introduction-to-descriptive-analysis.html)    
* [meantables](placeholder)   
* [freqtables](placeholder)    
</div>

##### One continuous variable

In this example, we want to calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval for continuous variables. Because this is an example, we will break it down into multiple steps. In a real analysis, we would probably put all of the code in this section into a single code chunk. 

**Calculations**

Do the basic calculations. Here we are using the `mean_table()` function from the `meantables` package. 

```{r}
one_cont_var <- study %>% 
  group_by(outcome) %>% 
  mean_table(age) %>% 
  print()
```

**Format statistics**

Combine the mean and 95% confidence interval into a single variable and keep only the columns of interest for reporting.

Additionally, we no longer need the `group_var` column and we will rename `response_var` to `var` to make it easier to row bind with our categorical variables later.

```{r}
one_cont_var <- one_cont_var %>% 
  mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
  select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
  print()
```

**Display by group_cat**

In the final table, we don't want the results stacked on top of each other vertically, we want them spread out horizontally across columns -- one column for each level (i.e., category) of our outcome variable. We can use `pivot_wider()` from the `tidyr` package to do this. See the chapter on [restructuring data frames](https://www.r4epi.com/restructuring-data-frames.html) for more info on pivot_wider.

```{r}
one_cont_var <- one_cont_var %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "group_cat",
    values_from = "mean_95"
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

**Add a blank row**

Finally, we want to add a blank row to the bottom of our results table. This will create some vertical separation between variables in our table when we eventually row bind all the variables together.

```{r}
one_cont_var <- one_cont_var %>%
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

**Putting it all together**

And that's the final result we are looking for. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```{r}
one_cont_var <- study %>% 
  # Calculations
  group_by(outcome) %>% 
  mean_table(age) %>% 
  # Format statistics
  mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
  select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
  # Display by group_cat
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "group_cat",
    values_from = "mean_95"
  ) %>%
  # Add a blank row
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

[Below](#table-functions-1), we will combine the whole sequence together into a function that we can call repeatedly on each of our continuous variables.

##### One categorical variable

In this example, we want to calculate the row percent and 95% confidence interval for categorical variables. Because this is an example, we will break it down into multiple steps. In a real analysis, we would probably put all of the code in this section into a single code chunk. 

**Calculations**

Do the basic calculations. Here we are using the `freq_table()` function from the `freqtables` package. 

```{r}
one_cat_var <- study %>% 
  freq_table(outcome, age_group) %>% 
  print()
```

**Format statistics**

Combine the row percent and 95% confidence interval into a single variable and keep only the columns of interest for reporting.

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>% 
  print()
```

**Keep columns of interest**

We only need the values from `row_cat`, `col_var`, `col_cat`, and `percent_95` in our final table. Additionally, we will rename `col_var` to `var` to make it easier to row bind with our continuous variables later.

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
  print()
```

**Display by row_cat**

In the final table, we don't want all of the results stacked on top of each other vertically as it is above. Instead, we want the results spread out horizontally across columns -- one column for each level (i.e., category) of our outcome variable. We can use `pivot_wider()` from the `tidyr` package to do this. See the chapter on [restructuring data frames](https://www.r4epi.com/restructuring-data-frames.html) for more info on pivot_wider. 

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "row_cat",
    values_from = "percent_95"
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

**Add spaces in front of category labels**

In our final Word table, we will want our category labels (e.g., "Younger than 30" and "30 and Older") to be indented slightly relative to the row variable label (e.g., "age_group"). We will go ahead and add 2 spaces now. 

<p class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** The spaces won't be visible while testing in RStudio, but they will show up in the final Word document. </p>

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>% 
  mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>%
  print()
```

**Slide category labels under row variable label**

In our final Word table, we will want our category labels (e.g., "Younger than 30" and "30 and Older") to be in the same column -- and underneath -- the row variable label (e.g., "age_group"). 

In other words, we want our final table to look like this:

| Characteristic    | No                    | Yes                   |
| :---------------- | :-------------------: | :-------------------: |
| Age Group         |                       |                       |
|   Younger than 30 | 56.14 (42.86 - 68.59) | 65.12 (49.54 - 78.02) |
|   30 and Older    | 43.86 (31.41 - 57.14) | 34.88 (21.98 - 50.46) |

Instead of this:

| Characteristic | Category         | No                    | Yes                   |
| :------------- | :--------------: | :-------------------: | :-------------------: |
| Age Group      | Younger than 30  | 56.14 (42.86 - 68.59) | 65.12 (49.54 - 78.02) |
| Age group      | 30 and Older     | 43.86 (31.41 - 57.14) | 34.88 (21.98 - 50.46) |

To do this, we will: 

1. Add a new top row to the data frame that will contain the variable label in the current col_cat column.   
2. Drop the current `var` column, which is no longer needed.   
3. Rename the `col_cat` to `var` to make it easier to row bind with our categorical variables later.   

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  add_row(col_cat = "age_group", .before = 1) %>%
  select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
  print()
```

**Add a blank row**

Finally, we want to add a blank row to the bottom of our results table. This will create some vertical separation between variables in our table when we eventually row bind all the variables together.

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

**Putting it all together**

And that's the final result we are looking for. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```{r}
one_cat_var <- study %>% 
  # Calculations
  freq_table(outcome, age_group) %>%  
  # Format statistics
  freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>%
  # Keep columns of interest
  select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
  # Display by row_cat
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "row_cat",
    values_from = "percent_95"
  ) %>% 
  # Add spaces in front of category labels
  mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>% 
  # Slide category labels under row variable label
  add_row(col_cat = "age_group", .before = 1) %>% 
  select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
  # Add a blank row
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

[Below](#table-functions-1), we will combine the whole sequence together into a function that we can call repeatedly on each of our continuous variables.

#### Create helper functions {#table-functions-1}

Above, we saw how to calculate the summary statistics we wanted for one continuous variable and one categorical variable. We could repeat that process for each variable we are interested in using copy and paste, but it is much more efficient and much less error prone to wrap those processes in a function that we can call repeatedly on each variable we want to analyze. That's what we will do in this section.

In each of the code chunks below, all we're going to do is cut the copy the code from above, paste it below, wrap it in the `function()` function, and then make a few tweaks that will allow us to repeatedly pass variable names into the code. See the chapter on [writing functions](https://www.r4epi.com/writing-functions.html) for more info on pivot_wider.

##### Continuous stats function

```{r}
cont_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Calculations
    group_by({{ .outcome }}) %>% 
    mean_table({{ .pred }}) %>% 
    # Format statistics
    mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
    select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
    # Display by group_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "group_cat",
      values_from = "mean_95"
    ) %>%
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}

# For testing
cont_stats_fn(study, outcome, age, .digits = 1)
```

##### Categoorical stats function

```{r}
cat_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Remove rows with missing values
    filter(!is.na({{ .pred }})) %>% 
    # Calculations
    freq_table({{ .outcome }}, {{ .pred }}) %>%  
    # Format statistics
    freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>%
    # Keep columns of interest
    select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
    # Display by row_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "row_cat",
      values_from = "percent_95"
    ) %>% 
    # Add spaces in front of category labels
    mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>% 
    # Slide category labels under row variable label
    add_row(col_cat = !!quo_name(enquo(.pred)), .before = 1) %>% 
    select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}

# For testing
cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, bmi_4cat, .digits = 1)
```

### Step 3. Create a data frame that contains our summary statistics

In general, we won't want to __present__ or __distribute__ summary statistics in the form of an R data frame. However, an preliminary step in creating our final table -- regardless of the method we use -- will usually be to create an R data frame that contains our summary statistics of interest.

The next step in this proc

```{r}
cont_cols <- c("age", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi")
```

```{r}
cat_cols <- c("age_group", "sex", "bmi_4cat", "exposure")
```

#### Repeatedly apply cont_stats_fn

Calculate summary statistics for each of the continuous variables we are interested in. Each time we pass a new variable to `cont_stats_fn` the result will be a data frame of summary statistics for that variable. For now, we will save each of those data frames to a list that we can later reorder and row bind together.

```{r}
stats_list <- cont_cols %>%
  set_names(cont_cols) %>% 
  map(~ cont_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x)))
```

#### Repeatedly apply cat_stats_fn

Calculate summary statistics for each of the categorical variables we are interested in. Each time we pass a new variable to `cat_stats_fn` the result will be a data frame of summary statistics for that variable. For now, we will save each of those data frames to a list that we can later reorder and row bind together.

```{r}
stats_list <- c(
  stats_list,
  cat_cols %>%
    set_names(cat_cols) %>% 
    map(~ cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x)))
)
```

At this point, `stats_list` contains all of our summary statistics of interest as a list of data frames. 

#### Bind together the continuous and categorical summary stats

```{r}
table_1 <- map_dfr(
  .x = c("exposure", "age", "age_group", "gender", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi", "bmi_4cat"),
  .f = ~ bind_rows(stats_list[[.x]])
) %>% 
print()
```

Remove the final blank row. It makes the Word table look cleaner.

```{r}
table_1 <- slice(table_1, -nrow(table_1))
```

<p class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** It might be interesting/worthwhile to come back to this at some point and turn everything from in "Step 3. Create a data frame that contains our summary statistics" into a function. </p>

### Step 5. Create flextable

At this point, we have a complete table of summary statistics and it is roughly laid out in the way we want it to be. But, as we discussed above, we don't want to __present__ or __distribute__ summary statistics in the form of an R data frame. The `flextable` package is one awesome tool we can use to transform our data frames of summary statistics into presentation-ready tables for Word, PowerPoint, or HTML documents. The [flextable] chapter gives more details on using the `flextable` package. But, for the sake of completeness, we will go ahead and finish our formatted Table 1.

Technically, the following single function call will turn our Table 1 into a `flextable` object. 

```{r}
table_1_ft <- flextable(table_1)
table_1_ft
```

### Step 6. Formatting flextable

The `flextable` object we created above is a good start; however, we will still want to do some additional formatting before presenting our final table 1 to others. 

<p class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** We could have done some of this formatting directly in the R data frame, but it's generally a good idea to do formatting in the `flextable` object when possible. </p>

```{r}
table_1_ft <- table_1_ft %>% 
  # Change column widths. figure out through trial and error
  width(width = c(2.5, 2.01, 2.01)) %>% 
  # Center the final two columns
  align(j = c(2, 3), align = "center", part = "all") %>% 
  # Change header names -- add subgroup Ns to headers
  set_header_labels(
    var = "Characteristic",
    No = paste0("No\n(n=", n_outcome["No"], ")"), 
    Yes = paste0("Yes\n(n=", n_outcome["Yes"], ")")
  ) %>% 
  # Bold column headers
  bold(part = "header") %>%

### 📝 Load Word template for officer

In general, it seems helpful/expedient to do as much of the prose and formatting as possible directly in the Word template. Then, just add numbers, tables, and graphs from R with bookmarks. 

```{r}
doc <- read_docx("../template_descriptive_analysis.docx") %>%
  body_replace_text_at_bkm("date", as.character(Sys.Date())) %>% 
  body_replace_text_at_bkm("n_table_1", as.character(sum(n_outcome))) %>% 
  body_replace_flextable_at_bkm("table_1", table_1_ft)
```


### 📝 Generate Word reports

```{r}
print(
  doc,
  "../Example Table 1.docx"
)
```
